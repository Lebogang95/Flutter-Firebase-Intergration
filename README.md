# Flutter Firebase intergration using MVP to keep it clean

A Flutter application made by Lebogang which demonstrates how to intergrate and use core Firebase features in your app. The app uses MVP to separate business and persistence logic from the views. The code is reusable across any Flutter application, to get it working you need to intergrate it into your app accordingly. It also uses custom widgets which are also reusable across any Flutter application as they don't depend on any specific part of an app.
